## About the Project

LLM evaluation of gamification integrated with education. Dependent on models imported from HuggingFace and a self-made dataset. The overall project was carried out in PyTorch ranging from the data preprocessing all the way to the evaluation.

## Prequesites
Have a late version of Python installed. The dependencies can be installed via the package manager PIP

## Dependencies
* ```sh
  pip install torch
  ```
* ```sh
  pip install transformers
  ```
* ```sh
  pip install numpy
  ```
* ```sh
  pip install scikit-learn
  ```

## Usage
1.  To access the notebook, follow the link set for the Google Colab notebook in the main page for this Github repository.
2.  Once it is opened, download the JSON file and have it stored in your File Explorer
3.  Connect to a runtime environment - preferably a GPU (e.g. T4 GPU) for faster training time
4.  Run each cell sequentially - for the data uploading cell, navigate to the JSON file downloaded and upload it
